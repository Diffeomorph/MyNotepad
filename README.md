# MyNotepad
Android notepad app

I have updated the graphics and layout of the following app, https://github.com/mick88/notepad. 

I have deleted the clipboard in the top right hand corner of the original app (but not on the individual notes) as it seemed superfluous.

I have changed the notes to CardViews.

I have changed the colour to Red from black and added a slightly different shade of red statusbar.

I have changed the icon for a new note to the android pencil icon.
